Final Project

CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2021

Currently I have 6 different objects made for the scene and another object made up of one of the other 6. This object is the tree and is made using recursion and seeds.
In addition, I also made the terrain and rocks randomly generated using Perlin noise in order to get local coherence between points, and this helped to make these objects more
natural looking. Then in the main scene it uses each of the objects I made and places them uniformly around the terrain. Finally, I added fog to the main scene in
order for it to look better. Also, I attempted to add shadows and reflections but was not able to get it working.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO LOOK AT/USE:
When looking at the scene the user can press v to change the scaling bias of the terrain, c to change the octaves of the terrain, x to change the seed, and q/Q to change the fog density
of the main scene. Additionally, v, c, and x will work on the rocks too. Also, when viewing the main scene you can go into first person by pressing m and move using the w, a, s, and d, and
the arrows to look different directions as well as using page_up and page_down to move up and down. Finally, if you press 5 you will be looking at a single tree and when you press r it
randomizes the tree.

Approximate time it took to complete the assignment: ~36 hours

Key bindings
   Esc           Exits the program.
   z             Toggles axis.
   c             Increments the octaves by one for the terrain or rocks depending on what object is being viewed.
   v             Increments the scaling bias which effects how independent each point is.
   x             Creates a new seed for the terrain or rocks and resets the octaves.
   r             Changes the trees.
   f/F           changes the fov.
   l/L           Toggles the light
   m/M           Changes between perspective and orthogonal projections
   i/I           Toggles the wireframe.
   q/Q           Increases and decreases the fog density
   0             Shows the main scene.
   1             Shows the simple tree branch.
   2             Shows the mushroom.
   3             Shows just the terrain.
   4             Shows the rocks.
   5             Shows the tree.
   6             Shows the flower
   7             Shows the Pine Tree
   +/-           increases/decreases the dim.
   arrow keys    Control the camera.
