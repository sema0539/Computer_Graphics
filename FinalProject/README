Currently I have most of the objects made, but I am working on making a couple more. With that said, I am still struggling with how I want to make the trees. Currently, I am
just making the trees using the tree branch object and having another function build the tree recursively using the tree branch, but I want to make the trees more interesting. So, I
started to try and apply the L-system algorithm for making the trees. In addition, I also want to try and make the tree a single object that's not made up of other objects. As for
what else still needs to be done, I still need to implement a better first person camera, I want to add fog to the scene, and lastly I want to try and implement reflections in the water.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO LOOK AT THAT ARE WORKING:
The Important things to look at right now are the objects in the main scene. In order to get to the main scene you just need to press 0 but it should be the first thing you see.
When looking at the scene pressing c and d will affect how the terrain looks, pressing r will change the trees, and pressing x will generate a new seed for the terrain. Due to the
fact I have not implemented the first person camera yet and it can be hard to see some of the objects you can view each object individually including just the terrain by pressing
1 which shows the tree branch, 2 which shows the mushroom, 3 which shows the terrain, 4 which shows the rock, 5 which shows the tree, or 6 which shows the flower. While looking at
the terrain and also the rock you can press c, d, or x to change how it looks.


Approximate time it took to complete the assignment: ~20 hours

Key bindings
  Esc           Exits the program.
  a             Toggles axis.
  c             Increments the octaves by one for the terrain or rocks depending on what object is being viewed.
  d             Increments the scaling bias which effects how independent each point is.
  x             Creates a new seed for the terrain or rocks and resets the octaves.
  r             Changes the trees.
  f/F           changes the fov.
  l/L           Toggles the light
  m/M           Changes between perspective and orthogonal projections
  w/W           Toggles the wireframe.
  0             Shows the main scene.
  1             Shows the simple tree branch.
  2             Shows the mushroom.
  3             Shows just the terrain.
  4             Shows the rocks.
  5             Shows the tree.
  6             Shows the flower
  +/-           increases/decreases the dim.
  arrow keys    Control the camera.
