Final Project

CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2021

Currently I have most of the objects made, but I am working on making a couple more. With that said, I am still struggling with how I want to make the trees. Currently, I am
just making the trees using the tree branch object and having another function build the tree recursively using the tree branch, but I want to make the trees more interesting. So, I
started to try and apply the L-system algorithm for making the trees. In addition, I also want to try and make the tree a single object that's not made up of other objects. As for
what else still needs to be done, I still need to implement a better first person camera, I want to add fog to the scene, and lastly I want to try and implement reflections in the water.


Approximate time it took to complete the assignment: ~20 hours

Key bindings
  Esc           Exits the program.
  a             Toggles axis.
  c             Increments the octaves by one for the terrain or rocks depending on what object is being viewed.
  d             Increments the scaling bias which effects how independent each point is.
  x             Creates a new seed for the terrain or rocks and resets the octaves.
  r             Changes the trees.
  f/F           changes the fov.
  l/L           Toggles the light
  m/M           Changes between perspective and orthogonal projections
  w/W           Toggles the wireframe.
  0             Shows the main scene.
  1             Shows the simple tree branch.
  2             Shows the mushroom.
  3             Shows just the terrain.
  4             Shows the rocks.
  5             Shows the tree.
  6             Shows the flower
  +/-           increases/decreases the dim.
  arrow keys    Control the camera.
