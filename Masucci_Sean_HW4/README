HW4: Projections

Sean Masucci
CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2021


Here is a 3d scene that has modes for a orthogonal and perspective projections. Also there is a mode with a first person
camera that uses the perspective projection. Most code is reused from HW3 and ex9, and I added code to the projection and display functions to
use the new perspective projection. Additionally, I changed some of the controls to work with the new modes

Approximate time it took to complete the assignment: ~4 hours

Key bindings
  x          Toggle axes
  m/M        Changes mode to for different projections
  arrows     Change view angle, also changes the direction you are looking when in FirstPerson mode
  +/-        Zoom in and out when not in FirstPerson mode
  w          When in FirstPerson mode this moves the camera forward
  s          When in FirstPerson mode this moves the camera backward
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit
