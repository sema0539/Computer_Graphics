HW6: Lighting and Textures

Sean Masucci
CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2021

Demonstrates using lighting and textures using my scene made from HW4. I reused code from ex13, ex14, and ex15 to help make the lighting and amp the textures
for the Scene and reused code from ex9 for the projections. Also I used some of the functions from CSCIx229.h.

Approximate time it took to complete the assignment: ~5 hours
