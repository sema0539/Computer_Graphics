HW3: Scene in 3D

CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2021


Here is my drawing of a 3d scene of two instances of a tree. I used code from example 8 to make the spheres and cube but the object that I made
was an attempt at a simple tree trunk shape. I originally started with a hexagonal prism that got smaller as it got taller, but I then
added a point where it starts to "bend" slightly and go in a different direction.

  ESC        Exit
